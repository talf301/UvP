Upholders Vs. Persecutors Instructions

*************Controls**********************

Player 1 (Upholders)
- WASD = Movement
- Left SHIFT = Select/Deselect/Attack
~
Player 2 (Persecutors)
- Arrow Keys = Movement
- Right SHIFT = Select/Deselect/Attack

***************Objective********************

The main objective of this game is for your side to conquer the other by either having all of your
pieces capture the blue power squares or by eliminating your opponent's team completely.

This is a turn based game kind of like chess, however, when two pieces on opposite sides land
on each other, an arcade-like battle starts.

**************Board********************

You can move your board cursor around and select a character on your team.  After that, you
may move that piece to a legit square. (If you want to deselect the character you selected,
press the key again when the cursor is above the character.)

There are two types of pieces: Flying pieces and Ground pieces.
Flying pieces can fly over characters on the board with no problem.  Their movement on the 
board is also slightly different than the Ground pieces.
Ground pieces cannot pass characters in the way.

To capture a power square, simply have your piece land on it.  You'll win if you have 5 of your
characters occupying the five squares at the same time.

There are three different types of squares (not including power squares):
-Neutral Squares (gray) -- No advantages are given in battle on either side.
-Upholders Square (white) -- Attack boost given in battle to the upholder.
-Persecutors Square (green) -- Attack boost given in battle to the persecutor.

*******************Battle************************

Two pieces will combat when they land on each other.

It is quite simple.  Simply move around dodging your opponent's projectiles while you yourself
shoot projectiles at your opponent.

Obviously, there is some strategy and reflex involved.
- There are rocks that can be used to block projectiles.
- You cannot "spam".  You can only shoot a projectile every 2.5 seconds.

Each character has different stats:
- HP -- Health Points are displayed on the sides of the screen (Uph. = left, Per. = right)
- Attack -- The projectile's strength
- Character Speed -- How quickly a character moves in battle
- Defense -- A stat to reduce the strength of your opponent's projectile
- Projectile Speed -- How fast your projectile travels.
- Movement -- How far they can move on the board.
*Note: Even if a character moves slow, doesn't mean his/her projectile is slow. (Same with fast.)

"Buzzers" are displayed on both sides of the screen in battle.  When it is green, the character
can shoot out a projectile.  On the other hand, if it is read, the character cannot.

When one character is depleted of all his/her health points, the other character wins that battle
and the board is displayed again.

***************Conclusion****************

All in all, this a game that is strangely fun as it involves both strategy and action that is sure to
attract many gamers.  Anything could happen, and there are some tense, but exciting times.
Honestly, even if you didn't understand the rules, you'll catch on pretty quickly.  So go on!  
PLAY!

**************Coming soon (maybe)***************

It was long said that two Great Rings held the world of Ring together.  These were two strips 
of land, surrounded by water, that criss-crossed each other.  At the two places where the Rings
met were the countries Annas and Eryll.  Annas was located on the highest of mountains.
Eryll was located within a peaceful valley.  These two countries spread their seeds and made
more countries.  They all co-existed in peace and harmony.

Until...

A war has been spread through the people of Ring.  The country Annas are attacking.
Their ruler, mad with power, plan to attack every land in sight.  Even the strongest of 
countries fall victim to the Annasians' growing power.  One small group, known as the
"Upholders" plan to stop this villain from ruling the world.  Though their leader, Einar,
does not know what is in store for them.
